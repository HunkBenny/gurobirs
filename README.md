# *WIP* gurobirs
Rust API for Gurobi

This crate provides a Rust-API to the GUROBI solver. The philosophy of this crate is to make the API resemble that of the C++-API whenever possible.

Making this API resemble the C++-API is counter-intuitive and probably leads to awful code, however, my goal is for people to be able to consult the C++-Gurobi documentation whilst using this crate.

### WIP
This is an active work in progress, a lot of functionality is already present. However, tests are lacking, documentation is lacking, and the code is horrible.
For the moment the focus lies on adding tests and documentation. Afterwards a lot of refactoring will be done.

Do not expect this crate to be stable before version 1.0.0 is reached.
